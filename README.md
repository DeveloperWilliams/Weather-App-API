# Weather App

This is a simple weather app developed in Python. It allows users to fetch weather data from an API and display it in a user-friendly format.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone git remote add origin https://github.com/DeveloperWilliams/Weather-App-API.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd weather-app`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. Run the app: `python app.py`
2. Enter the location for which you want to fetch the weather data.
3. The app will display the current weather conditions for the specified location.

## API Key

To use this app, you will need to obtain an API key from a weather data provider. Once you have the API key, create a file named `config.py` in the project directory and add the following line:

```python
API_KEY = 'your-api-key'
```

Replace `'your-api-key'` with your actual API key.
